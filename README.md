Folder Renamer for Image Libraries
==========

Folder Renamer:

Rename your image folders based on the EXIF date and/or the file creation dates. 

Useful when migrating from Picasa to a professional photo workflow (Lightroom, etc).

Safe to run on the same set of folders multiple times - will detect if folder has already been renamed.

==========

Picasa Date Embeder:

Convert Picasa ini dates to file/directory dates.

This is mainly useful:

*If you are importing images from sources other than a digital camera (film or scans).
*If you run image optimization apps (JPEGmini, etc)  on your existing library so that it changes the original dates.


The log for this process is not very informative, but it should work.
