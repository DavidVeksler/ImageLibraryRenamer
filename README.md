**Folder and File Organization  for Large Image Libraries:**
==========

- Useful when migrating from Picasa to a professional photo workflow (Lightroom, etc).
- Safe to run on the same set of folders multiple times - will detect if folder has already been renamed.

*Tools (Run in this order before migrating your library to Lightroom):*
- Picasa Embeder: Read dates from .picasa.ini files and convert them to file create dates
- Folder Renamer: Rename your image folders based on the oldest EXIF date and/or the file creation dates. 
- Folder Name Parser: Read the date from the folder name and use them for the file create/modify date.
